Iterable Datasets represent a flexible way to handle large volumes of data in machine learning pipelines.
They enable the sequential processing of data, allowing for efficient handling of datasets that might not fit entirely into memory.
With Iterable Datasets, you can load batches of data on-the-fly, preprocess them, and feed them into your model incrementally.
This process is crucial for optimizing computational resources and handling datasets that are too large to fit into memory entirely.
